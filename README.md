##### Made for Ubiquiti  

\
UI Full-Stack home assignment - “Reminders App”
### Implemented Stories
##### Predefined Stories
*  I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list
*  I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we can (for example) edit our family shopping-list together
*  I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus on things that are still pending
*  I as a user can filter the to-do list and view items that were marked as done - so that I can retrospect on my prior progress
*  I as a user can add sub-tasks to my to-do items - so that I could make logical groups of tasks and see their overall progress
*  I as a user can make infinite nested levels of subtasks
*  I as a user can add sub-descriptions of tasks in Markdown and view them as rich text while I'm not editing the descriptions
*  I as a user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has it's unique URL that I can share with my friends - so that I could have separate to do lists for my groceries and work related tasks
*  I as a user can keep editing the list even when I lose internet connection, and can expect it to sync up with BE as I regain connection
*  I as a user can be sure that my todos will be persisted so that important information is not lost when server restarts
*  I as an owner/creator of a certain to-do list can freeze/unfreeze a to-do list I've created to avoid other users from mutating it
*  In addition to regular to-do tasks, I as a user can add “special” typed to-do items, that will have custom style and some required (<-- optional) fields. (Food) [Slightly changed]

##### Custom Stories
*  I as a user can see the latest to-do list and access it from the index page
*  I as a user can set a password on a to-do list, to manage the accessibility of the list, as well as share the password with trusted friends
*  I as a user can shorten the URL and share it with friends
